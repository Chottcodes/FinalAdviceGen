Aaron Robinson - Everything works as intended, I like how you used relative,absolute, and h-0 for the dice button to stick to the bottom of the div i might steal that. I would try to put the adviceComponent directly into the main.jsx im not 100% sure if having the components in the App.jsx is necessary at all, I would give it a shot. Also matching font to example. Great work all in all.
